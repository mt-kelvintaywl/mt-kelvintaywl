#### Communications

- Work Hours: 09:00 - 18:00
- _Slack_ me anytime within my work hours 🤓
- **BUT** please respect my Slack status; if I am away, I am unlikely to reply
- Emails are **probably the worst way** to reach me; I view emails as notifications at best 🙇
- Feel free to put an event in my calendar! I'm free as long as my calendar says I am 👍
